1	契丹侵澶，萊公相真宗北伐，臨河未渡。	Zhao Qi, however, took refuge in the hills of Danyang, and he was then sent to take refuge from the rebels of WEI. He was sent across the frontier to take up camp in the north of the empire.
2	是夕，內人相泣。	Before this, men of mean origin had been conscripted as soldiers.
3	明日，參知政事王欽若請幸金陵，樞密副使陳文忠公堯叟請幸蜀。	On the day xinhai, the emperor saw Wang Xiu, recognised his true appearance, and asked him about the succession to the throne. Chen Qiu answered in the same manner as his father.
4	真宗以問公，公曰：“此與昨暮泣者何異？”議數日不決，出遇高烈武王，而謂之曰：“子為上將，視國之危不一言，何也？”王謝之。	"When Duke Cao asked him about the Duke of Zhou, he asked him why, and asked him, ""Cao Cao raised the Son of Heaven to rule the empire, but he failed to match the achievements of Duke Cao of Qin. He failed to follow the examples of Dou Wu and Cao Cao, and so his power has fallen apart. He is now a man of no use for the state. How can he be of any use to you?"""
5	乃復入，請召問從官，至皆默然。	So he stopped, went back to his lodging and asked for some food.
6	楊文公獨與公同，其說數千言，真宗以一言折之曰：“儒不知兵！”又請召問諸將，王曰：“蜀遠，欽若之議是也。	"Yang Ci, however, realised that Yang Ci would not be easy to deal with, and he sent his Attendant Officer Yang Ci to ask him about the proposals. He was not pleased, and said to him, ""Cao Cao's ambitions have long been imitated, but he still plans to take over the imperial clan. He will not be able to maintain hiscontrol over the people, and will certainly cause you trouble."""
7	上與後宮御樓船浮江而下，數日可到。”	Later, in the autumn of the seventh month, with the rising of the Moon of the Black Emperor rising above the sea, the imperial palace could not be reached. More than a hundred thousand people remained in their tents, and even at night they could not see them.
8	殿上皆以為然，公大驚色脫。	All the ministers sent in memorials on behalf of Wang Fu, and Yuan Shu was pleased to receive them.They bowed to their excellencies, and they bowed to him.
9	王又曰：“臣言亦死，不言亦死，與其事至而死，不若言而死。	"but Wang Wang also said, ""I have heard that Mao Jie and Wang Lie were both condemned to death for failing to report to the law, and that since they were alive, I have never heard that they have died because I was unwilling to obey them. So I too, not even to speak against it, have come to this fate."
10	今陛下去都城一步，則城中別有主矣！	"""The city within the city is still unsettled, and only the leader of the city can hold his city."
11	吏卒皆北人，家在都下，將歸事其主，誰肯送陛下者？金陵可到邪？”	Now the men of the family who had come from the same commandery came back to their homes, and all the men from their families who had been banished from their homes now came to join them.The men of your majesty should be dismissed, and each of them would receive your majesty's seal and ribbon as an officer of the imperial house.
12	公又喜過望，曰：“瓊知此，何不為上駕邪？”	"Guo Tai recognised his true feelings, saying, ""The Excellency over the Masses, Cao Cao was truly a true gentleman. Why should I be able to obtain those honours?"
13	王乃大呼：“逍遙子！”公掖真宗以升，遂渡河而成功。	King Qiao, King of Chenliu, had a great assembly of his sons, and his father Wang Hui, Duke of Hejian, who had held office in the past,became a great leader of the imperial house. He crossed the Yellow River and set his camp at Henei, and when he crossed the river he achieved the great design.
14	欽若愧其議，讒於真宗曰：“寇準孤注子爾！”	When Yang Qi first came to the capital, his father was ashamed and ashamed of him, and he said to his nephew Cao Cao that though his father had been captured by the barbarians, his sons had not been banished to Cao Cao's territory.
15	博者謂窮而盡所有以幸勝為孤注，言以人主而一決也。	Those who want to make trouble are told that there is a man who is making trouble by his own accord, but who has no intention of making trouble. Because of this, many people believe there is someone who is planning a coup against us.
16	澶淵之役，真宗欲南下，萊公不可，曰：“是棄中原也。”	The Duke of WEI is a man of great ambition, but he is not yet strong enough to deal with Cao Cao. He does not know whether he is right or wrong, nor is he behaving like a commoner.
17	又欲斷橋，因河而守，曰：“是棄河北也。國之存亡在河北，不可棄也。”	Chen Gui was afraid he might not be able to hold his position, so he crossed the Yellow River and came to Yong province. He asked the Protector of the West of the North, Cao Cao, not to go, but to go to the north.
18	澶淵之役，所下一紙書爾：州縣堅壁，鄉村人保，金幣自隨，穀不可徙，隨在瘞藏，寇至勿戰。	"""""Even if a man is starving and thirsty, and his fellow-towns are starving, even when the roads are blocked and there are floods, he will stay in his hiding place and make no change to his clothing. Even as the floods are rising, there are no-one who can be trusted to keep them out. The men of the province are discouraged and discouraged, and the women of their villages are hungry and thirsty. No-one can see how they can see or tell whether they are being kept in their homes. They sigh and sigh and mumble something to themselves to themselves, while the men of our country are ashamed to remain in their villages. They are afraid that even when they are starving and starving, they will not dare to come out to the market-place."
19	故虜雖深人而無得，方破德清一城，而得不補失，未戰而困。	"""In former times, when the rebels were strong and there was no peace, it was not possible to capture the city [of Yiling], but instead instead the city fell into ruin and the city was destroyed."
20	真宗既渡河，遂幸澶淵之北門。	and he crossed the Yellow River to join Yuan Shu. He crossed the pass to the west of the passes, and the emperor came to the gates of the city [of Hejian], where he passed through the gates [of the city of Yong'an].
21	望見黃蓋，士氣百倍，呼聲動地。	When Guo Si first came to power he was extremely fond of him, and many people would come to him to see him.
22	兵既接，射殺其帥順國王撻覽，虜懼，遂請和。	The leaders of the Wuhuan rebelled, and the General Who Subdues the West was killed. He took the head of Wang Gui and set himself in the market-place. So he was able to set up his own commandery.
23	澶淵之役，詔諸道會兵而合擊。	After Xiahou Yuan's army was defeated, Yuan Shao took command of his men and raised troops. He attacked and completely defeated them.
24	既和，縱其去。	He was going to leave, but he thought he was sure to win, so he left his wife and children and went away.
25	又詔諸將按兵，遣使監楊延朗。	An edict sent an edict to send the General of the Household Wei Feng to send detachments of foot-soldiers to escort Zhang Yang into Jing province.
26	時虜使在館，既諭旨，遽曰：“請遣中官，貴諸將取信一也。”	At this time, when Cao Cao was leading a campaign to the Qin, he had only a few dozen men in attendance, and he sent messengers to say that he was at the gates of the palace, and that all the officers and people of thecommandery should respect his authority and obey his orders.
27	而虜亦請使送款，遂以全歸，懷之至今。	He sent messengers to ask pardon for the men who had been sent back to their native villages, and he sent them back asking to be treated as if he was the son of an imperial marquis. Now he has also received the invitation to attend the funeral.
28	澶淵之役，真宗使候萊公。	"""Xiahou Yuan is a descendant of Duke Cao of WEI, and he has sent messengers to appoint Xiahou Shang as Protector of the Xiongnu and to send envoys to make contact with Duke Cao."
29	曰：“相公飲酒矣！”“唱曲子矣！”“擲骰子矣！鼾睡矣！”	Then Cao Cao was beginning to say that he was ashamed to be a father to a son, and that he should be ashamed to act like a common fellow. He was ashamed and ashamed, and he could never againaccept the words of a son.
30	澶淵之役寇准上真宗書	Xiahou Yuan was made Protector of the Xiongnu, and the successors of Zhou Yu were sent by the Xiandi to maintain a siege of Shangguan.
31	萊公既逐死，家無遺文。	"""Lord Chen has died, and there is no house for his family."
32	嘉祐中始得奏章一紙，憂其復失而並記之，使後者有考焉。	How much more likely that Zhong Yao would find a hiding place for his family, and that he would find one of his close friends to hide in a secret corner, while he would continue his quiet talk for several years, and even through the end of the campaign, there was no-one who recognised his good work.
33	曰：臣奉聖旨擘畫河北邊事及駕起與不起、如起至何處者。	"Yuan Shao, former Director of the Secretariat, sent in a memorial to say that, ""The Yellow Turbans of the north have risen up together together, and the emperor must send in a sealed memorial that they should come to the south."
34	一、近邊奏契丹遊騎已至深、祁，竊緣三路大軍見在定州，魏能、張凝、楊延朗、田敏等又在威虜軍等處，東路深、趙、貝、冀、滄、德等州別無大軍駐泊，必虜契丹漸近東南下寨，輕騎打劫，不惟老小驚駭，便恐盜賊團聚，直至大名府以來，人戶驚移。	"""At this time I have only just arrived in Dangzhong, and my officers and men of the commandery have been sent out on campaigns to the east and the west.I ask permission to go to Yuyang, Zhao and Kuaiji, to make contact with the leaders of the Shao and Ji tribes [of the Xiongnu] and to make plans with them. I ask to have your majesty pay your respects to the two marquises [of Liang and Ji]. They are famous among the people of the east, and they are respected by all the eastern provinces. If you allow me to bring them to join you, and send them to take supplies for the siege-lines [of Jibei]. I ask that you grant me a small salary, and to send them back to the provinces of Shang and Ji, while I shall arrange for [the leaders of] Liang province to join me in the east"
35	若不早張軍勢，竊恐轉啟戎心。	If you cannot be sure of the strength of the army, then the army will certainly be disturbed and confused. If you do not accept the orders of the General Who Subdues the West, Zhang Lu will be afraid that your forces will be too weak to maintain your authority.
36	臣乞先那起天雄軍馬萬人，令周瑩、杜彥鈞、孫全照將領往貝州駐泊，或恐天雄軍少，且起五千人，只令孫全照部轄。	In my humble opinion, all the officials of the Three Excellencies, moreover, should be numbered by the tens of thousands, and should send men to supervise all the military affairs of the empire, so that all the lands west of the Yellow River may be governed as if they were a whole country. Then there would be no more need for men to accompany the imperial carriage, and the taxation requirements of the army would be less than that of that of a single county. Then the taxation of the people would be reduced by half, and all the men of the provinces would be able to go to the provinces.
37	若虜騎在近，即近城覓便襲擊，兼令間道將文字與石普、閻承翰照會掩殺，及召募強壯人虜界，燒蕩鄉村，仍照管南北道，多差人探候契丹，次第聞奏，及報大名。	"Yuan Shao had only recently arrived in Jing province.When he saw that the enemy were approaching, he sent messengers to say to him, ""Yuan Tan and his officers were in close pursuit, and they had only just crossed the Yangzi and had crossed the Huarong River. Zhang Zhao and Zhu Jun were also in pursuit of them, but they were not able to capture them, and instead they fled south to the north of the River. They crossed the Yellow River and lived amongst the barbarians of Jing province, while Zhong Yao, leader of the BlackMountain bandits, and the other leaders of the Shaoqiang, were killed or wounded in a series of engagements. They heard about it, and he planned to attack them with a force of ten thousand men. They planned to kill the leaders of their army, but in the north they were caught by bandits and killed, while the heads of the leaders"
38	一則貴安人心；二則張軍勢以疑敵謀；三則邊將聞王師北來，軍威益壯；四則與邢、洛不遠，成犄角之勢。	"""At one time I was leading leading men from the region of the north to attack Zhang Jue's army, but I was afraid the two armies would join their forces, and when the leaders of their armies would have heard of it they would join to oppose you: each side would be prepared to accept the authority of the other, and neither would accept the other's authority, and each would expect to be given the same authority as his leader."
39	一、隨駕諸軍，扈衛宸居，不可與犬戎交鋒原野，以爭勝負。	The best thing to do is go back to Boma and wait for Zhang Xiu tocome to join him. He would use the resources of his army to give help in this campaign, and that would be like paying no attention to a child who is young.
40	天雄至貝，軍士不過三萬人，萬一契丹過貝下寨，遊騎益南，即須那起定州軍馬三萬以上，令桑贊等結陣南來鎮州，及令河東雷有終將兵出土門路與贊會合，相度事勢緊慢，那至邢、洛，方可聖駕順動，且幸大名，假萬乘之天聲，合數路之兵勢，更令王超等千定州近城排布，照應魏能、張凝、楊延朗、田敏等，作會合次第及依前來累降指揮牽拽。	"When the General-in-Chief [Liu Bei] arrived in Runan he brought twenty thousand men to join him. He planned to shift the troops of the Three Adjuncts to the north of the Yangzi, while the Lieutenant-General Dong Cheng and the Colonel Who Maintains the Caitiffs [Sun Ce] went with him to Jing province, while others joined him in a combined attack from south to the west.They set up camps at the Huainan Pass, and all the officers and men of the commandery came forward to pay their respects to the emperor and to say farewell to their fathers and kinsmen.Huang Gai and the others saw how well-trained troops had prepared themselves, and they sent messengers to say to him, ""You have only to wait for the autumn of the year, and you will be able to make plans to seize Jing province.Then you will join forces with the Northern Army"
41	一、恐契丹置寨於真、定之間，則定州軍馬抽那不起，邢、洛之北，遊騎侵掠，大名東北縣分，老小大段驚移，須分定州三路精兵，令在彼將帥會合，及令魏能、張凝、楊延朗、田敏等漸那向東，傍城寨牽拽。	At this time, the leaders of the Shanyu of the Eastern provinces, Duan Jiong and Zhu Jun, and the Protector of the Wuhuan, were all leading men from the east of the passes, and they planned to force the provincial and commandery offices into Yi province. They planned to shift the offices of the Inspector of Youbeiping, Liang Ji, Zhang Ji and the Chancellor of You province, while they would join forces with the Eastern Supplies and Collector-in-Chief to attack the bandits west of the Yellow River.They planned to combine forces to seize the northern provinces of Jing province and Beidi, while the Beidi and Kuaiji people would join to join forces in a combined attack on the north of the mountains. They would make plans to move into Jing province, east to the north, and east from there they would shift their troops from Youbei and Shangdang to join
42	如此，則契丹必有後顧之憂，未敢輕議懸軍深入。	"""Since the time of the Duke of Zhou, everything has gone wrong, and the court has been unable to return to the proper way."
43	若車駕不起，轉恐夷狄殘害生靈，如蒙允許，亦須過大河，且幸澶淵，就近易為制置會合，兼控扼津梁。	"The emperor was afraid the men of Faction would not be able to keep control of their troops, so he sent messengers to call him back from Hongnong and to say farewell to his former officers, and to make peace with the Xianbi, but not make alliance with the rebels. He also sent a memorial to say that, ""Tian Kai [Liang Ji] is a danger to the empire, and that he will certainly upset the feelings of the people. His ambitions are far greater than that of his own."
44	右臣叨列宰司，素無奇略，既承清問，合罄鄙誠。	I have received great favour from the excellencies and ministers, and I have been successful in every direction since the time of the Restoration [of Emperor Huan], but I have never been able to gain success in the market-place.
45	伏惟皇帝陛下，睿知淵深，聖猷宏遠，固已坐籌而決勝，尚能虛己以詢謀，兼彼犬戎頗乏糧糗，雖恃腥膻之眾，必懷首尾之憂，豈敢不顧大軍，但圖深入？然亦慮其凶狡，須至過有防虞。	"""Your majesty is young and weak, and you have only just arrived in the west. Even now, when your majesty is approaching the end of the road, you are not prepared to deal with the difficulties of the past. Even as you count the numbers of your troops, you still have no idea how to make plans for a sudden change, and so you have failed to keep control of your men."
46	煩黷天威，伏增戰慄。	The empire fell into disorder and Yuan Shao fled to Chang'an.
47	始講和，虜使韓祀匿其善飲，曰：“兩國初好，數杯之後，一言有失，所誤非細。”	When he first came to office, he hated the idea that he might ever have to deal with such a group of wicked men, so he sent in a list of several hundred names, beginning with Zang Ba, the most distinguished scholar of the past.
48	後使姚柬之，既去而顧，手顙再三，是以知虜之情也。	"Later, when he sent a messenger to ask forgiveness for his failure, Chen Fan reprimanded him, ""It was only because I had pity for the orphan girl, and that he was allowed to live in the same house as you. When I knew I would win, I knew that I would be enfeoffed even more than that before he had left."
49	姚柬之曰：“宋之事力，契丹之士馬皆盛，然北軍用于阻隘，不能敵南；平原馳突，南軍亦不能支也。”	Cao Cao's advice was not followed, and he disregarded the advice of the scholars of the time. He gave orders that the men of his army should be withdrawn to the north of the Yangzi, and when they heard that his army had been defeated, they were afraid they might not be able to cope with the situation. He raised troops to help him restore order, and in the end he managed to pacify Jing province, but he did not manage to capture Jing province.
50	慶歷二年，西羌盜邊，戰未解，契丹保境使請關南十縣之地及昏。	In the winter, in the tenth month, the Qiang of the Western Garden had been camped in the south of the city. Zhang Huan and the other leaders of the county tried to persuade them to join him, but after more than ten days they had been captured and sent to labour service in the southern hills. They were then sent to the labour camps of the Shanyue and the Huarong Prison.
51	丞相申公使其黨御史中丞賈文元公館之，許昏與加賜使擇焉，而遣知制浩富韓公諭意。	Cao Jie, Minister of the Imperial Chancellor, sent the Imperial Clerk Chen Shi to take account of the good work of the excellencies and other senior officials, and the former Excellency of Works Chen Fan of Chenliu, who had long been a close friend of Huangfu Gui. He sent in a memorial to criticise Chen Fan for his conduct, and he accepted his arguments.
52	既見問故，虜主曰：“宋塞鴈門、廣塘水、繕城隍、籍民兵，非違約邪？群臣亟請用兵，孤謂不若求地也。”	"When Guo Jia asked the emperor about it, he asked him why, and asked why, saying, ""The roads to the capital were not well maintained, and the roads were difficult to reach. Cao Cao and Xu Huang [Cao Cao] were both afraid that the people would not be able to come to him. I ask permission to bring soldiers to look after the people, but I have not heard that they are afraid of the soldiers outside."
53	公曰：“契丹忘章聖之大德乎？澶淵之役，使從眾，契丹無還者，寧有今日耶？且契丹之所欲，戰爾，戰非契丹之利也。	"""Lord Cao is like Duke Cao of Qi, and yet you compare him to the Duke of Zhou. What is this mean that you want to punish him? Isn't that like asking him for gold and silver? 'If you pay no attention to the price of a horse today, then tomorrow you will find yourself in the midst of the mud and mud."
54	從古至今，夷狄得志於中國，惟晉氏爾。	When I first came to the commandery, it was only because of the eunuchs in the state of [Hanyang].
55	方是時，主弱而愚，國小而貧，政刑不修，命令不行，百姓內潰。	At this time there were great disturbances in the empire, and the government was in constant disarray. As a result, ministers and ministers could not carry out their official duties, so they consoled and doled out favours.
56	諸將外叛，故契丹能得志。	"""My officers and people are exhausted, and my only wish is to make peace with them."
57	然土地不守，子女玉帛歸于臣民，契丹蓋無得也。	The people of Jiaozhi, however, had no land to live, and their wives and children were forced to flee to the border. They could not cope with this, and so they were compelled to give up their children.
58	而人畜械器，亡者大半，故德光死，述律怒不肯葬，曰：‘待我國中人馬如故，然後葬汝！’戰而勝，其害如此，況不勝邪！今契丹與宋好，歲得金繒數十萬，入于府庫，國之利也。	"""I am a man from a broken family, with broken bones, broken bones and broken bones. At the present time, with no communication with the outside, and with no contact with men from the past, how can I face the four limbs and stand upright and make no move for fear? And now, with my own misfortune, I have met with death with the same speed as the ruler himself. This is the pity of it. And how can this be permitted to be allowed to continue to continue with such a disregard for humanity?"
59	故和則上得其利，戰則下得其利，上受其弊。	If we accept this arrangement, then our soldiers will be able to find work and the people will enjoy the good life. If we take advantage of their difficulties, then we can take advantageof their difficulties.
60	故契丹之臣，皆願解和而構戰，與國爭利，奈何舍己之利以利人邪？”主大悟，點首久之。	"""I have heard that your majesty [the majesty of] the Three Excellencies] and the Gentlemen of the Left have been involved in the misfortunes of the barbarians. They are the cause of the troubles of our state, and they are the source of all troubles. They should be punished and punished, and your majesty should take account of their good work."
61	公復曰：“塞鴈門以備羌，塘始于何承矩，事在約前，地卑水聚，歲久則廣；城隍完故，民兵補缺，非違約也。	Dong Zhuo considered that since ancient times, when the Qiang had not fully recovered their strength, it was easy to make plans for these Qiang and other barbarians to withdraw to the interior, and he planned to use the water and the water to bring water to the cities and the people. The roads and roads, however, were long and difficult to reach, and many of the cities were abandoned and abandoned. The soldiers and sailors were exhausted and useless, and the men of the commanderies and counties had no experience of war.
62	晉遺盧龍，周取關南，皆異代事。	"""When the Duke of Zhou of Zhou first came to the south, he had all the scholars of the commanderies and counties south of the Yangzi, and all the local scholars knew how the Southern Shanyue had come to power."
63	若按圖而求舊，豈契丹之利也哉！皇帝以兼愛為心，守祖宗之約，不願用兵，顧兄弟之義，不欲違情，而為天保民，為先保土，不得以與人。	"""Now my majesty has inherited the property of my late father, and I have inherited the imperial title. I wish to redeem myself from the disgrace of former times, and to redeem the name of the Xiongnu. I ask to be allowed to act as his Assistant,""replied Zhao Yan, ""and that would be the most generous tribute."
64	謂契丹乏金幣，歲遺以永誓好。	Duan Jiong said that in the past that the gold and silver were cheap and abundant, he had received fiefs and gifts from the feudal lords. He once boasted of his achievements in the military service, and he boasted that he had held high position as a marquis.
65	古者敵國有無相通，必皆欲背約絕好而加兵，宋安得而避哉！且澶淵之盟，天地臨之，其可欺乎！”乃請昏，公曰；“兄弟之國，禮不通昏，男女之際，易以生隙，且命修短不可期，不若歲幣之久也。”	"""I have heard it said that 'the ruler of a state is weak, while the people are greedy andwant nothing.' If he neglects the responsibilities of a ruler, he will certainly be a drain on the state, and he will be a danger to the state. And even if he wants to act as a king, he cannot bring himself to do so. Why should I care about his feelings?"""
66	始，契丹請婚，欲因以多求，及公固拒，群議未決而難其久，又謂空言無實，使歸取誓書。	Zhang Huan is now a man of great ambition, but he has not yet achieved his ambition. He wants to marry the daughter of the eunuchs, and he wants to set up a household at the gates of the palace [of the palace]. So he has asked to see the matter first, and in return he is promised a high position in the official service. So he is hoping to accede to some position but he is not expecting this. So his words are vague and vague and he has nothing more to say.
67	及再至，定增歲幣二十萬。	When they arrived, they met the two hundred thousand men from the same commandery, and they spent ten years together together.
68	始，契丹一請，宰相遽塞以二事，且使自擇，遂以為怯，有輕宋心，欲以增幣為“獻”與“納”，公不可，曰：“此下事上，臣事君，乃非敵國之禮也。	"""Before this, I was a servant of the eunuchs, and my responsibilities were always to carry out the imperial orders. I was appointed magistrate of Danyang, and so I carried out the duties of a subject. I did not receive imperial orders from the royal house, but instead I sought to please the ruler, so that he would treat me as a lesser official, and allow me to act as an equal. So I have received favour from the imperial house, and you have granted me authority to grant appointments. I have always received favour and favour, and your majesty has granted me full authority. I am a loyal servant, and I have held responsibility for the imperial commands. I do not intend to change my position, and have always carried out my duties as a servant. This is why I have been given appointment as a Senior Clerk, but I was always treated as a subordinate."
69	且章聖已有歲遺，不為此名，貨非國之輕重，鄙而失國，古雖小亦不為也。”	In former times, when Gaozu [Zhang Song] was a young man, he had no intention of setting up a separate state, and he had never received the courtesy of a ruler. Even though he pretended to be a great official, he was in fact a petty fellow. He was a common fellow, and his achievements and achievements were few and obscure.
70	主曰：“古有之，何獨吝邪？”公曰：“古惟唐高祖臣事突厥，假其兵而取隋，則或有之；及太宗擒頡利、突利兩可汗，寧複有邪！”主不語，其臣劉四知侍，退數步。	"""In former times, when Duke Cao of WEI was Chancellor of the Excellency of Works, he held office at the Palace of Prolonged Joy, and he held the high position of Intendant of the Second Army. He held the highest position and held position as Grand Tutor,but he could not maintain his position and so he failed to achieve the great design. How can you accept such a man as your leader? And how can you trust him to such a dangerous enemy? And should I trust Lord Cao to hold the Staff of Authority? And he be of the same rank as Guan Ba? ""I have heard that he held position at the time of the First Emperor [Yuan Shao], and when I held the imperial carriage [in the Second Emperor], he held high position and shared the imperial title. And when he was engaged in the war at Guangling, he was worthy of the highest positions, and"
71	公又曰：“石晉亦因契丹而得國，不惟稱臣，亦父事之，或可用此。	"""Lord Cao of Chen commandery has shown great generosity, and he has granted great grants to the poor and the poor. He has given generous rewards to the worthy and able men, and his government has been generous and generous. It is quite wrong that he should give such rewards to some eunuchs, but it is only because he is concerned for your honour and his honour."
72	今宋與契丹，無唐、晉之援，而為敵國，豈有此邪！”將退，主曰：“卿謂孤故作此一節必不可事，豈非不欲保和邪！孤實無此意，卿歸勿為此言，恐誤宋大事耳。”	"""Now that I have failed to gain the emperor's favour, however, I have no wish to make plans for my own advantage. I wish to go to the east of the Yangzi and join Zhao Yun and Cao Cao, but I have not yet made up my mind what to do. I would rather rather prefer to wait for the time to come, but now that I am certain to fail, I am afraid I may not be able to do so. That is why I want to return to the west, and I intend to stay here. This is not the way to plan for a long time. That would be the right way to do things. That way, I would be making plans for the emperor. Thatwould be like making a coup against Cao Cao.
